# 🛒 Amazon E-Commerce Experience

## Project Overview
Welcome to a high-fidelity shopping cart application designed to replicate the seamless user flow of the world’s largest retailer. This project wasn't just about building a store; it was about mastering the **logic of commerce**—handling state management, dynamic pricing, and a secure checkout experience.

As a developer with a background in social impact and digital strategy, I built this clone to explore the intersection of **technical scalability** and **intuitive user experience (UX)**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Philosophy
This project serves as a showcase of modern web architecture:

* **JavaScript:** Chosen to ensure minimizing bugs in the checkout logic (a must for any project handling financial data).
* **State Management:** (e.g., Redux or Context API) Used to synchronize the cart across multiple pages.
* **CSS Modules/Tailwind:** Implemented to achieve that iconic, clean "Amazon-blue" aesthetic.
